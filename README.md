# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Just a quick website I made for CS50W's project0
First time I used Html/CSS/SCSS and Bootstrap, so it's far from perfect

Created this "website" in around 6 hours.

### index.html ###
Homepage that I put the most work into, checke with components Bootstrap had available
and started with the navbar, then the rest.

### resistor.html, capacitor.html, diode.html ###
Once I was done with the index.html and found a good topic to make a website around I mostly
spend the rest of my time to check off the tasks that were set by CS50W (table, list, SCSS inheritance and nesting etc.)
