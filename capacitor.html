                    <h1>The Capacitor</h1>
                    <p>
                        A <span class="component">capacitor</span> is a passive two-terminal electrical 
                        component that stores potential energy in an electric field. The effect of a capacitor is 
                        known as capacitance. While some capacitance exists between any two electrical conductors 
                        in proximity in a circuit, a capacitor is a component designed to add capacitance to a 
                        circuit. The capacitor was originally known as a condenser or condensator. 
                        The original name is still widely used in many languages, but not in English.

                        The physical form and construction of practical capacitors vary widely and many capacitor 
                        types are in common use. Most capacitors contain at least two electrical conductors often 
                        in the form of metallic plates or surfaces separated by a dielectric medium. A conductor 
                        may be a foil, thin film, sintered bead of metal, or an electrolyte. The nonconducting 
                        dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as 
                        dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, paper, mica, and oxide layers. 
                        Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. 
                        Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy.
